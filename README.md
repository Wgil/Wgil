# Hi, I’m Warao 👋 [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://linkedin.com/in/warao) 

I’m a **product-focused frontend / full-stack engineer** with **10+ years of experience** building and shipping user-facing applications. I work close to the product, own problems end-to-end, and enjoy turning complex systems into **clear, intuitive, high-leverage experiences**.

I care deeply about **UX, system clarity, and reducing friction**—between frontend ↔ backend, product ↔ engineering, and users ↔ complex technology. While frontend is my core strength, I regularly step outside strict role boundaries when it helps the team move faster or build better abstractions.

## What I Work On

- **Frontend & full-stack web applications**  
- **Product-driven interfaces**: UX, clarity, accessibility, and reliability over unnecessary abstraction
- **Complex system integration**: Frontend ↔ backend ↔ Web3 / blockchain systems

## Recent Work

### **Elys Network**

I helped take the product **from idea to mainnet**, scaling to: **2M+ users**, **$7M TVL**, **$55M+ trading volume**.

I initially led **frontend and product initiatives**, then stepped deeper into the backend when gaps appeared. To unblock progress, I ramped up on **Rust and Go**, identified avoidable system complexity, and helped **removing a CosmWasm proxy layer** that was increasing coupling and slowing development.

**Impact:**
- Clearer system boundaries  
- Lower maintenance overhead  
- Faster iteration  
- Better cross-team collaboration and onboarding for new hires

## Open Source & Ecosystem Collaboration

I engage with open source when it improves real production systems—whether that’s contributing code, reporting upstream issues, or helping maintainers debug tricky edge cases.

### 🌱 Elys Ecosystem (Cosmos / Web3)

- **Elys Asset Registry**  
  Active collaborator on the asset registry used across the Elys ecosystem, working closely with the core team to ensure correctness, consistency, and long-term maintainability.  
  <https://github.com/elys-network/elys-asset-registry>

- **Elys Core Repositories**  
  Small but meaningful contributions across the main codebase—often outside my frontend role—to debug production issues, improve interfaces, and unblock teams.  
  <https://github.com/elys-network/elys/commits?author=Wgil>

### 🧠 Legacy OSS Issues I’m Still Proud Of

Older contributions, but good examples of how I approach debugging, communication, and public technical problem-solving:

- **redux-form**  
  <https://github.com/redux-form/redux-form/issues/2325#issuecomment-487162582>
- **Formik**  
  <https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/issues/2057>
- **redux-firestore**  
  <https://github.com/prescottprue/redux-firestore/issues/45#issuecomment-519727035>

## How I Like to Work

- **Product first** — user needs, clarity, and reliability come before abstractions  
- **Ownership** — comfortable being accountable for the final user-facing result  
- **Collaboration** — close work with design, backend, and stakeholders  
- **Adaptability** — learn new tools quickly when the problem requires it  
- **Pragmatism** — simple solutions beat clever ones

## Outside of Code

I enjoy working on **early-stage products**, improving **onboarding flows**, and helping teams move faster with **less friction**. I’m especially drawn to roles where **engineering, product, and real users intersect**.  

Beyond product work, I love **exploring new technologies**, whether it’s **building mining rigs, tinkering with hardware setups, or experimenting with new frameworks and tools**. Staying hands-on with tech keeps me curious and constantly learning.  

📫 Feel free to reach out if you enjoy working with **thoughtful, low-ego teams building real products**.
