# Hi, I'm Warao 👋 [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://linkedin.com/in/warao) 

I'm a **product-focused frontend / full-stack engineer** with **10+ years of experience** building and shipping user-facing applications. I work close to the product, own problems end-to-end, and enjoy turning complex systems into **clear, intuitive, high-leverage experiences**.

I care deeply about **UX, system clarity, and reducing friction**—between frontend ↔ backend, product ↔ engineering, and users ↔ complex technology. While frontend is my core strength, I regularly step outside strict role boundaries when it helps the team move faster or build better abstractions.

## 🔭 Currently

- Building a **B2B SaaS ticketing platform** (validating product-market fit)
- Experimenting with **AI-assisted development workflows** (Claude Code, Cursor, MCP protocols, CodeRabbit)
- **Open to full-stack or frontend engineering roles** (remote/hybrid)

## What I Work On

**Frontend & Product:** Building user-facing applications with focus on UX, clarity, and accessibility  
**Full-stack Integration:** Complex systems spanning frontend ↔ backend ↔ Web3/blockchain

## Recent Work

### **Elys Network**

I helped take the product **from idea to mainnet**, scaling to: **2M+ users**, **$7M TVL**, **$55M+ trading volume**.

I initially led **frontend and product initiatives**, then stepped deeper into the backend when gaps appeared. To unblock progress, I ramped up on **Rust and Go**, identified avoidable system complexity, and helped **remove a CosmWasm proxy layer** that was increasing coupling and slowing development.

**Impact:**
- Clearer system boundaries  
- Lower maintenance overhead  
- Faster iteration  
- Better cross-team collaboration and onboarding for new hires

## How I Like to Work

- **Product first** — user needs, clarity, and reliability come before abstractions  
- **Ownership** — comfortable being accountable for the final user-facing result  
- **Collaboration** — close work with design, backend, and stakeholders  
- **Adaptability** — learn new tools quickly when the problem requires it  
- **Pragmatism** — simple solutions beat clever ones

## Outside of Code

I enjoy working on **early-stage products**, improving **onboarding flows**, and helping teams move faster with **less friction**. I'm especially drawn to roles where **engineering, product, and real users intersect**.  

Beyond product work, I love **exploring new technologies**, whether it's **building mining rigs, tinkering with hardware setups, or experimenting with new frameworks and tools**. Staying hands-on with tech keeps me curious and constantly learning.
